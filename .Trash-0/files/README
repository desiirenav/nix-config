I am by no means an expert in quickshell, learning and vibe coding in the process.
This is for my own use, but if it helps you, great!
still working on:
- System tray
- Notifications instead of swaync + swayosd
- confirmation dialogs
- maybe a lock screen
- better right click menus
- better styling
